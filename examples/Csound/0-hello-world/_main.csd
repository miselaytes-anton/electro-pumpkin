;  Hello World - Csound on Bela
; 	* Bernt I. WÃ¦rstad, Victor Lazzarini, Alex Hofmann
;
;
; This first example focusses on the different comment-types
; and shows a simple Csound example, which generates a "440Hz beep"
; sent to Bela's left audio output and prints "Hello World" to the
; console.
;
; To start it, press the RUN Button in the BELA-IDE.
